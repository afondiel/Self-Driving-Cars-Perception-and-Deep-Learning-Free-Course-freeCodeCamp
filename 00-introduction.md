# Introduction

## Key Takeaways:

- The course is about perception for self driving cars using computer vision and deep learning

- Perception and Computer Vision form about **80%** of the work that Self-Driving Cars do to drive around.

- The course will cover different tasks that a Self-Driving Car Perception unit would be required to do, such as:
  - **Road Segmentation**: identifying the drivable area of the road using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).
  - **2D Object Detection**: locating and classifying objects in the image using You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm.
  - **Object Tracking**: tracking the movement and location of objects over time using Deep SORT algorithm.
  - **3D Data Visualization**: transforming and projecting 3D data from LiDAR sensors using Homogenous Transformations.
  - **Multi Task Learning**: performing multiple tasks simultaneously using a Multi Task Attention Network (MTAN).
  - **3D Object Detection**: detecting and localizing objects in 3D space using SFA 3D algorithm.
  - **Camera to Bird's Eye View**: converting the camera image to a top-down view of the scene using UNetXST algorithm.

All the **datasets and code notebooks** are provided for the projects
