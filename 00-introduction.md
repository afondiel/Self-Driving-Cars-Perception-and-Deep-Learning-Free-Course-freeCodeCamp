# Introduction

## Key Takeaways:

- The course is about perception for self driving cars using computer vision and deep learning
  
- The course consists of eight projects, covering both 2d and 3d aspects of perception.
  
- The projects are:

  - Road segmentation using fully convolutional networks
  - 2d object detection using Yolo algorithm
  - Object tracking using Deep SORT
  - 3d data visualization using camera images and LIDAR data
  - Multi task learning for depth estimation and semantic segmentation
  - 3d object detection using PointNet
  - Bird's eye view visualization using **transformers**

All the **datasets and code notebooks** are provided for the projects
