# Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation - Review

# Abstract
- The paper proposes and evaluates fully convolutional networks (FCNs) as a powerful and efficient method for semantic segmentation.
- FCNs are trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, and apply to spatially dense prediction tasks with state-of-the-art results.
- The paper also introduces a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations.

# Introduction
- Semantic segmentation is the task of assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, such as sky, road, person, etc.
- The paper aims to address the limitations of previous methods for semantic segmentation, such as patch-based classification, sliding-window detection, and region-based segmentation, which are either inefficient, inaccurate, or require post-processing.
- The paper proposes to use fully convolutional networks, which are convolutional networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output, without any fully connected layers or pre-defined output shape.

# Problem and Solution (Methodologies)
- The paper defines the problem of semantic segmentation as a pixelwise prediction task, where the goal is to learn a mapping from an input image x to an output label map y.
- The paper uses convolutional networks as the basic model for learning this mapping, since they are powerful visual models that yield hierarchies of features.
- The paper adapts conventional convolutional networks for image classification into fully convolutional networks for semantic segmentation, by replacing the fully connected layers with convolutional layers, and using upsampling layers to produce dense predictions.
- The paper also uses skip connections to fuse features from different layers, and fine-tunes the networks from pre-trained classification models.

# System Architecture Pipeline
- The input image is fed into a convolutional network, which consists of a series of convolutional, pooling, and activation layers.
- The output of the convolutional network is a feature map of lower resolution and higher dimensionality than the input image.
- The feature map is then upsampled to the same size as the input image, using deconvolution (or transposed convolution) layers.
- The output of the deconvolution layers is a score map of the same size and number of channels as the input image, where each channel corresponds to a class score for each pixel.
- The score map is then normalized by a softmax function, and the final prediction is obtained by taking the argmax of the score map for each pixel.
- The paper also introduces a skip architecture, which adds skip connections from lower layers of the convolutional network to higher layers of the deconvolution network, to combine semantic and appearance information.

# Findings
- The paper evaluates the performance of FCNs on four semantic segmentation datasets: PASCAL VOC 2011, PASCAL VOC 2012, NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow.
- The paper compares FCNs with previous methods, such as patch-based classification, sliding-window detection, region-based segmentation, and recurrent neural networks.
- The paper reports that FCNs outperform previous methods on all datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results, while being fast to infer.
- The paper also analyzes the effects of different design choices, such as the base network, the upsampling method, the skip architecture, and the fine-tuning strategy.

# Conclusion
- The paper proposes and evaluates fully convolutional networks as a novel method for semantic segmentation, using classification networks as a starting point and applying skip connections to combine features from coarse and fine layers.
- FCNs achieve improved segmentation results on various datasets and are fast to infer.
- The paper demonstrates the power and efficiency of FCNs for spatially dense prediction tasks, and draws connections to prior models and methods.
