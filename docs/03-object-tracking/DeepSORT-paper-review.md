Title: "Streamlining Object Tracking: An Overview of SIMPLE ONLINE AND REALTIME TRACKING WITH A DEEP ASSOCIATION METRIC"

**Abstract**
- Introduction to Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT).
- Enhancement of SORT with deep association metric.
- Significant reduction in identity switches during tracking.

**Introduction**
- The challenge of multiple object tracking in real-time.
- The importance of integrating appearance information.
- The goal to improve SORT's performance.

**Problem and Solution (Methodology)**
- The issue of occlusions and identity switches in tracking.
- SORT's approach using a deep association metric.
- Pre-training on a large-scale dataset for robust performance.

**System Architecture Pipeline**
- The architecture of SORT with a deep association metric.
- The process of measurement-to-track association.
- Utilization of nearest neighbor queries in visual appearance space.

**Findings**
